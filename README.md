## Project Title
Adidas Sales Performance

## Brief One Line Summary
Interactive analytics dashboard quantifying Adidas US sales performance across products, regions, and channels (2020–2021).

## Overview
This project evaluates Adidas’s US sales performance during the highly volatile years of 2020–2021, when the pandemic disrupted consumer behavior, retail operations, and global supply chains. The goal was to derive actionable intelligence that could be consumed by cross-functional stakeholders: product teams, regional managers, and channel strategists.  

The deliverable is a reproducible, data-driven dashboard that provides stakeholders with insights into revenue drivers, underperforming segments, and regional imbalances. The dashboard is designed to serve as a decision-support system—translating transactional sales data into KPIs tied directly to revenue growth, channel optimization, and product development priorities.  

The intended audience includes data analysts, business strategists, and product managers who require near real-time clarity on performance trends and the business levers behind them.  

## Problem Statement
Adidas US needed clarity on sales drivers and underperforming segments following pandemic-related disruptions. Revenue surged 445% year-over-year ($132M → $718M), but dependencies (Men’s Street Footwear dominance, Amazon-driven e-commerce reliance, South region underperformance) created strategic blind spots. Success was defined by identifying growth levers, quantifying opportunity gaps, and enabling stakeholders to reallocate marketing spend, optimize product portfolios, and rebalance regional investments. KPIs include revenue growth, channel mix percentage, and regional market share delta.

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of **24 months (2020–2021) of Adidas US sales transactions**, merged with product and retailer metadata.
