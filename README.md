## Project Title
Adidas Sales Performance

## Brief One Line Summary
Interactive analytics dashboard quantifying Adidas US sales performance across products, regions, and channels (2020–2021).

## Overview
This project evaluates Adidas’s US sales performance during the highly volatile years of 2020–2021, when the pandemic disrupted consumer behavior, retail operations, and global supply chains. The goal was to derive actionable intelligence that could be consumed by cross-functional stakeholders: product teams, regional managers, and channel strategists.  

The deliverable is a reproducible, data-driven dashboard that provides stakeholders with insights into revenue drivers, underperforming segments, and regional imbalances. The dashboard is designed to serve as a decision-support system—translating transactional sales data into KPIs tied directly to revenue growth, channel optimization, and product development priorities.  

The intended audience includes data analysts, business strategists, and product managers who require near real-time clarity on performance trends and the business levers behind them.  

## Problem Statement
Adidas US needed clarity on sales drivers and underperforming segments following pandemic-related disruptions. Revenue surged 445% year-over-year ($132M → $718M), but dependencies (Men’s Street Footwear dominance, Amazon-driven e-commerce reliance, South region underperformance) created strategic blind spots. Success was defined by identifying growth levers, quantifying opportunity gaps, and enabling stakeholders to reallocate marketing spend, optimize product portfolios, and rebalance regional investments. KPIs include revenue growth, channel mix percentage, and regional market share delta.

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of **24 months (2020–2021) of Adidas US sales transactions**, merged with product and retailer metadata. 

## Key Insights

* 445% YoY growth: $132M (2020) → $718M (2021), validating post-pandemic rebound.

* Men’s Street Footwear dominance: 70% of 2021 sales; signals concentration risk but strong collaboration potential.

* Women’s Athletic Footwear underperformance: consistently lagging; product redesign and influencer tie-ins required.

* Regional imbalance: West generated 55% of total revenue; South represented a $38M opportunity gap.

* E-commerce surge: share increased from 18% (2020) → 42% (2021), requiring continued digital investment.

* Amazon dependency: drove 62% of online growth; threatens margin capture and brand control.

* Retailer leverage: Foot Locker and Amazon combined = 45% of footwear sales; validates B2B partnerships.

* Midwest mild improvement: last → second-last performer; shows incremental progress but not enough to change portfolio strategy.

##Results & Conclusion

* Revenue Growth: +445% YoY ($132M → $718M).

* Channel Shift: E-commerce share grew from 18% → 42%.

* Regional Gap: South region lagged by ~$38M vs. expected baseline.

* Interpretation: Adidas rebounded strongly post-pandemic but faces over-reliance on men’s street footwear, Amazon-driven sales, and regional imbalance.

##Future Work

* Incorporate predictive models for demand forecasting.

* Expand dataset to 5-year horizon for seasonality capture.

* Integrate external market/competitor benchmarks.
